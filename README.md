# Roadmap

- Create a tool to scan important HTML tables to detect changes to the data format

# Known Issues

- hunter.js code is not reliable for getting game data for some seasons since the website has lightly updated HTML unless `get_games` (the most up-to-date function) correctly gathers data
- `games.game_duration` data not loading correctly--all values are null
- see PerGameStats/README.md for per-game stats known issues
