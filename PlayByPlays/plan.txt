GENERIC PLACEHOLDER
    P1, P2, P3.. depending on which involved player is being represented in the play
    HT and AT to denote home and away team respectively?? Is this possible?
    FT for the feet distance text

download html rows
    parse person and feet and replace all generic data with the GENERIC PLACEHOLDERS
    if not in PLAY CACHE of unique plays
        insert into it
    insert into PLAYS associating GAME and PLAY CACHE row. set quarter / time     
      if not in PLAYACTION CACHE
        insert, setting GENERIC PLACEHOLDER for team or player, and associating to PLAY CACHE!
        keep description column empty to allow for me to review and describe the play cache
      insert PLAYACTION 
        associate player OR team, the PLAYACTION CACHE row, the PLAY
        set proper GENERIC PLACEHOLDER flag per the associated player/team
        set feet if applicable

LONG TERM
    PLAYACTION CACHE management
        my admin UI will show a list of undescribed PLAYACTION CACHE rows to allow for me to describe it
        the django model will string represent the row via the description if present or use the PLAY CACHE text plus GENERIC PLACEHOLDER value in some clever way

    MAYBE fix my django models to do django orm migrations again--BE CAREFUL
